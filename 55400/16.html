	<p class="block_"><img src="images/image-147.png" alt="Image" class="calibre4" /></p>
	<p class="block_">Our journey in Power BI Desktop comes to its conclusion in this lab and the experience joins with the
		Power BI service (Online) which we have used in our first report focused lab to create new insights into data. In our
		business scenario at House Rules Board Games, we have qualified our report by running it past our stakeholders. </p>
	<p class="block_">During the meeting, individuals have been impressed with your work and have asked for you to
		personalise the report for some key individuals. Your advice is to use dashboards to dissect and filter the data for
		individuals. You have explained that you will create a quick dashboard showcase, to help them understand how to use
		this fantastic tool to perform their own analytics from the report.</p>
	<p class="block_">For this exercise you will need to open your <b class="calibre6">House Rules Sales Analysis</b>
		project file which was completed in Lab 5. If you did not finish the last lab, we have a completed file for you to
		continue from. Simply open your download pack, and open the folders <b class="calibre6">Completed Labs </b>&gt; <b
			class="calibre6">Lab 5 – Reports</b> then open the PBIX file and continue working from this save point.</p>

	<p class="block_">To move our attention over to Power BI (Online) where our report is to be hosted and shared, we will
		first need to publish our report. This is a quick process; however, we will need to make sure Power BI Desktop is
		signed in as the correct account before we can publish to a workspace.</p>
