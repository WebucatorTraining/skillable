  <p class="block_">A new requirement has come your way at House Rules Board Games. A group of stake holders would like to
    gather more insights into their transactional database using intelligent reporting. They have provided a series of
    grain statements for the report to include, and you have spoken to your IT team about accessing the data. </p>
  <p class="block_">Because you have discussed the requirements with all the relevant parties, we will now create a new
    project file using Power BI Desktop. We can then connect to the relevant data sources required for our data model and
    design a series of queries to refine the data. Once ready we will review the relationships that we have created in our
    model.</p>
