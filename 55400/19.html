	<p class="block_">These exercises are always improved upon through feedback from students. Where we find most students
		struggle to complete exercises in the allotted time frame, we often remove exercises that do not have a major impact
		on the end result. However, in some cases students still express an interest in resolving challenges that occur in
		these removed exercises, such as correcting regional data. In our dataset we have inaccurate geographical data. We can
		correct this by introducing another lookup table that pairs the first part of the customers UK postcode with a more
		accurate list of counties. If you would like to try this out, you will either need your completed PBIX file or the
		completed solution from <b class="calibre6">Labs</b> &gt; <b class="calibre6">Completed Labs</b> &gt; <b
			class="calibre6">Lab 5 - Reports</b>. </p>

						for example a county being set to Leicester when Leicester is a city not a county. The city field is also
						incorrect for a lot of our data. </p>
