# Lab A - Setting up your trial

For this course you will need an Office 365 tenant to work from. In this Lab we will provision a tenant and set it up with the appropriate accounts and services required for this training. Note that you can do this whole course directly from your own computer, however we can also offer a Windows 10 virtual machine that you can use to run PowerShell commands from, rather than using your own computer.

# Exercise 1 - Create a new Outlook account

In this first exercise you will create a new Outlook.com account that will be used as your external email address for this course. The account can also be used as your contact mail address for setting up your new Microsoft 365 tenant.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE**:** *You only need to do step 1 if you are using a hosted Windows 10 Virtual machine. If you are using your own desktop, you can ignore Step 1 and go straight to step 2.*  |

1. Log in to your Client desktop using the following credentials: (You may already be logged in depending on your classroom environment setup)

1. Username = Admin
2. Password = SpAdmin365

The next step is optional, you are going to create a new Outlook account, this account is going to be used as your primary contact address when creating a new 365 tenant so you don’t need to use your own personal or work email address. If you want to use your own email address that is also fine, and you can skip this exercise and move straight to the next exercise to create a new tenant.

1. Open a browser of your choice
2. Browse to <https://outlook.live.com/owa/>
3. Click on **Create free account**
4. Create yourself a new Outlook account by filling in the fields and performing the security check
5. Once created make a note of your new Outlook account

# Exercise 5 - Create users with Azure Management Shell

In this exercise you will connect to your Azure Active Directory and create some new users that will be used for testing.

1. Return to your windows PowerShell or open Windows PowerShell using **Run as administrator** type the following commands and press **Enter**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*If you still have your previous Azure AD connection open in PowerShell you can skip this step.* |

1. Import-Module MSOnline

1. For any issues click [here](https://www.easy365manager.com/msonline-module-installation-and-troubleshooting/)

1. Connect-msolservice
2. In the credential pop up box enter the following
3. Email address = [steve@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:steve@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com) where XXXX is your unique number – click **Next**
4. Password = SpAdmin365 – click **Sign in**

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-499.png)  

1. When you have been authenticated type the following:

1. **Get-Msoluser** and press **Enter**

You should receive a return showing only Steve is in the tenant but is also licensed  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-500.png)  

1. In the command type the following (replace XXXX with your unique number)

1. **New-MsolUser –UserPrincipalName pete@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com –DisplayName “Pete Coventry” –FirstName “Pete” –LastName “Coventry” –Password ‘SpAdmin365’ -ForceChangePassword $false –UsageLocation “GB”**
2. Press **Enter**

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-501.png)  

1. Repeat step 3 for the following users:

1. Ashley Curtis
2. Mark Summers
3. Shannen Smith
4. Tom Gooch

Pressing the up arrow will allow you to quickly select your previous command and amend it. Use the left and right arrow keys to move left and right of commands 

1. Now run the following command to see the status of the users (your users will show your unique number)

1. **Get-Msoluser**![Graphical user interface, text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-502.png)

Notice that the 5 new users are not licensed, so let’s add a license (you could also run get-msoluser -unlicenseduseronly if you just wanted a filtered view)  

1. To assign Pete a license type the following command, replacing XXXX with your unique number

1. **Set-MsolUserLicense -UserPrincipalName pete@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com –AddLicenses “CKXXXX:ENTERPRISEPREMIUM”**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*If you have used a different tenant type such as an E3 you will need to change the license type to match. For example: CKXXXX:ENTERPRISEPACK. Use Get-MSOLAccountSKU to find out your license type.* |

1. Repeat step 6 and add a license for Ashley, Mark, Tom and Shannen
2. Re-Run **Get-Msoluser**

You should now have all users licensed

1. In the PowerShell prompt type the following and press **Enter**:

1. **New-SPOSite -Url https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/hr -title "HR Home" -Owner steve@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com -storagequota 1024   
-Template STS#0**(for CKXXXX use the unique number you used earlier in this exercise)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*It can take 10-15 minutes for this to create* |

1. After the script has completed type the following in SharePoint Management Shell and press enter:

1. Get-SPOSite

Ensure your new site collection is listed  

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-520.png)  

If you are still waiting for your site to be provisioned you can refresh the active sites page in the SharePoint admin center to see when it appears, then repeat step 4

Next you will install the pnp extensions and then create a modern site collection in PowerShell.

1. In the SharePoint Management shell type the following:

1. Type **Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell**  

For any issues installing this module please consult the article below:  
[MSOnline Module - Installation and Troubleshooting - Easy365Manager](https://www.easy365manager.com/msonline-module-installation-and-troubleshooting/)
2. Type the following to connect to your tenant using pnp

1. **Connect-PnPOnline -url https://CKXXXX-admin.sharepoint.com/ -Interactive**
2. Under pick an account, either select **Steve’s** account of, if Steve’s account is not there, select **Use another account** and sign in as Steve  

![Timeline  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-521.png)
3. At the bottom of the consent screen click **Accept**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*This command is appropriate for this tenant as we have disabled multifactor authentication. In a tenant with MFA enabled, you would use this command in its place:*Connect-PnPOnline –Url https://CKXXXX-admin.sharepoint.com/ -Interactive*Enter your credentials if asked.* |

1. Type the following command to create a new modern team site with a Microsoft 365 group

1. **New-PnPSite -Type TeamSite -Title 'Team CK' -Alias TeamCK**
2. Press **Enter**
3. Check that you browse to the site <https://CKXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/TeamCK>

1. Use the New-PNPSite command to create two more site collections called:

1. ProjectSite
2. TeamSite

You will be using these new sites later in this lab for testing  

1. In the SharePoint Online Management Shell run the following command and press enter to check all the new site collections are listed

1. **Get-SPOSite**![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-522.png)

You can also check by visiting the Active sites page in the SharePoint Admin center. (You may need to refresh the page to see the new site collections). You will now add a new user to one of the site collections and make them a site collection administrator.

1. In the SharePoint Online Management Shell type the following commands:

1. **Set-SPOUser -site https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/hr -LoginName shannen@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com -IsSiteCollectionAdmin $True** (Replace XXXX with your tenant ID)

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-523.png)  

To check if Shannen is an admin via PowerShell, you need to query for all users with the ‘IsSiteAdmin’ field  

1. In the SharePoint Online Management Shell type the following:

1. **Get-SPOUser -Site https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/hr | where {$\_.IsSiteAdmin}** (Replace the XXXX with your tenant value)

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-524.png)  

Now let’s get a list of all site collections and the owners for them  

1. In the SharePoint Online Management Shell type the following:

1. **$spoSites=Get-SPOSite | Select \*** and press **Enter**
2. On the next line enter **foreach($spoSite in $spoSites)**

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*After typing this you will now be typing in double tram lines >> (see the screen capture on the next page for what it should look like). Run each line below one at a time unless you are using PowerShell ISE then you can run the commands as one run.* |

1. **{**
2. **Write-Host "Admins for " $spoSite.Url -foregroundcolor Yellow**
3. **Get-SPOUser -Site $spoSite.Url | where {$\_.IsSiteAdmin}**
4. **Write-Host**
5. **}**

You should now get a return of all site collections by URL and by owners

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-525.png)  
Because you used a variable for $sposites at the start of that script you could use that command for future scripts as well providing you don’t close your PowerShell command box. Variables only stay in memory whilst the PowerShell command box is open.  

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-526.png)

As you can see combined multiple commands and building variables in memory you can make large numbers of changes quickly across all site collections a lot quicker than you can in the admin console.

# Exercise 5 – Implement custom branding

Now that we have a Hub site, we can use PowerShell to create a custom theme, and then apply it to the Hub Site. The hub site will cascade this theme to any associated site. We will recommend a theme for this exercise however if you wish to deviate and use your own company branding, you can give it a go, you will just need the company’s primary colour in a HEX code format.

1. In your web browser window, open a new tab

1. Navigate to: <https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/heads/master/theming-designer/index.html>
2. In the *Fluent UI Theme Designer* enter your HEX colour codes into the *Primary*, *Text* and *Background color* fields on the left side of the page, if you want to use our branding guidelines, use the values shown below:

1. *Primary color*: **#e2b700**
2. *Text color*: **#333333**
3. *Background color*: **#ffffff**

![Diagram  Description automatically generated with low confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-537.png)  

1. A preview will appear on the right, confirm you are happy with the look, note you may get the warning, “*Your color palette has 2 accessibility errors. Each pair of colors below should produce legible text and have a minimum contrast of 4.5”* which relates to your contrast in colours, if you can read your text clearly you can ignore this warning
2. At the top-right of the page, click **Export theme**
3. Select the **PowerShell** tab
4. Leave this tab open, as we will need the generated code later

Next, we will need to use the SharePoint Online Management Shell to connect to our SharePoint service and deploy the new theme. To do this we will need to open the application and sign in. If you already have the application open, skip to step 10

1. Press the **Start** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-538.png) key on your keyboard and type in **SharePoint**
2. Right click on **SharePoint Online Management Shell**and choose **Run as administrator**  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-539.png)
3. In the command line window after enter:  

**Connect-SPOService –Url https://CKXXXX-admin.sharepoint.com**  
(replacing XXXX with your tenants unique numbers)  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image570.png)
4. Press **Enter** and the management shell will launch a dialogue box requesting an email address which will be your test account as you are a global administrator, enter your Steve’s account email address and click **Next**  

![A picture containing graphical user interface  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-540.png)
5. Enter Steve’s password and click **Sign in**

The SharePoint Online Management Shell is connected to our SharePoint service, and we have our theme generated in Microsoft’s Fluent UI theme designer. We now need to submit a command to create a new theme and combine it with the code we have generated.

1. In the SharePoint Online Management Shell, on the new line enter:  

**$themepalette =**
2. Make sure your cursor is after the = character and press **Shift** + **Enter** to create a new line
3. Navigate to the web browser tab containing your theme code and copy it to your clipboard by clicking on the code and pressing **Ctrl** + **A** followed by **Ctrl** + **C**  
![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-541.png)
4. In the management shell paste the code after the = character by pressing **Ctrl** + **V**, but **DO NOT** press enter
5. After the last } bracket press **Shift** + **Enter** to create a new line
6. On the new line enter:  

**Add-SPOTheme –Name ”Corporate Theme” –Palette $themepalette –IsInverted $false**
7. The code will look a bit like this however the hex codes and theme name will vary based on your choices:  

$themepalette =

@{

"themePrimary" = "#e2b700";

"themeLighterAlt" = "#fefcf4";

"themeLighter" = "#fbf3d2";

"themeLight" = "#f7e9ad";

"themeTertiary" = "#eed45f";

"themeSecondary" = "#e6c11c";

"themeDarkAlt" = "#cca700";

"themeDark" = "#ac8d00";

"themeDarker" = "#7f6800";

"neutralLighterAlt" = "#faf9f8";

"neutralLighter" = "#f3f2f1";

"neutralLight" = "#edebe9";

"neutralQuaternaryAlt" = "#e1dfdd";

"neutralQuaternary" = "#d0d0d0";

"neutralTertiaryAlt" = "#c8c6c4";

"neutralTertiary" = "#c2c2c2";

"neutralSecondary" = "#858585";

"neutralPrimaryAlt" = "#4b4b4b";

"neutralPrimary" = "#333333";

"neutralDark" = "#272727";

"black" = "#1d1d1d";

"white" = "#ffffff";

}

Add-SPOTheme -Name "House Rules" -Palette $themepalette -IsInverted $false  

1. Press **Enter** to create the theme  

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-542.png)

Now that we have created a new theme, we will apply it to our hub site. Because the management shell connected to the SharePoint service, other SharePoint sites in our tenant can also use our new theme.

1. Return to the browser tab containing your hub site from a previous lab (if you cannot locate this access [www.office.com](http://www.office.com) in a private browser using your test account and navigate to **SharePoint** and then select **Marketing**)

# Exercise 6 - Configure storage quotas

In this exercise you will manually configure storage quotas and then change the value of a site collection.

1. Open the SharePoint admin center if you closed it

1. Click on the **Settings** page link in the left-hand navigation, then choose **Site storage limits**

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image579.png)

1. Change the option from automatic to **Manual** and click **Save** on the page
2. Return to **Active sites** using the left menu

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*This change might take some time to commit. Refresh the active sites page after 3-5 minutes to see the new columns. It may take a couple of refreshes before the ribbon icon becomes available.* |

1. To confirm that change select a site in the active sites list and on the site properties page notice you have a ‘Storage limit’ option and you can edit it

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-546.png)  

1. Select the HR site collection go to the information panel and click **Edit** under storage limit
2. Change the Quota to **5GB** and **Save** the change. Ensure the new storage level is correct in the UI for the site collection

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-547.png)  
Let’s now configure quota in PowerShell  

1. Open the SharePoint Online Management Shell and connect to SPOnline if you closed it from the previous exercise (refer to the earlier steps if you need help opening and connecting to your tenant in PowerShell)
2. Enter the following PowerShell command and press enter:

1. **Set-SPOSite -identity https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/intranet -StorageQuota 15000 -StorageQuotaWarningLevel 13000** (Change XXXX with your tenant number)

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image582.png)

Let’s now run a PowerShell command that will change the quota on all current site collections. 

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*you will not be able to change the StorageWarningLevel with this script for the MySite Host Site Collection. It does not stop the script working and you could filter out the URL’s to avoid the error message.*A screen shot of a computer  Description automatically generated with low confidence |

1. Type the following in the SharePoint Online Management shell

1. **$spoSites=Get-SPOSite | Select \*** then press **Enter**
2. **foreach($spoSite in $spoSites)** then press **Enter**, then use **Shift** + **Enter** to create new lines containing the following:

1. {
2. Write-Host "Changing Quota for " $spoSite.Url -foregroundcolor Yellow
3. Set-SPOSite -identity $spoSite.URL -StorageQuota 12500 -StorageQuotaWarningLevel 11000
4. Write-Host
5. }

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-549.png)

![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-550.png)

After running the command return to the Active sites list in the SharePoint admin center and verify the quotas have been changed to the new amount. You may notice the value has been rounded up.

# Exercise 8 - Restore Site Collections

In this exercise you are going to delete site collections using the UI, then restore one site collection and finally permanently delete the second using PowerShell.

1. Open the **Active sites** page in the SharePoint admin center

1. Select the **Team Site** Site Collection
2. In the ribbon, select **Delete**

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-573.png)  

1. On the confirmation page select **Delete the group** click **Delete** again

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-574.png)  

1. Repeat these steps for the **Project Site** site collection
2. Return to the SharePoint admin page, expand **Sites** and then open **Deleted sites** then refresh the page

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-575.png)  

1. You should have the two site collections listed, select the **Team Site** site collection and click **Restore** from the ribbon, and click **Restore** once more to restore the group

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated | Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated |

1. Confirm that the site collection has been restored in the active site collection list
2. Return to the SharePoint Online Management Shell   
(if you have closed the management shell, reopen it and enter **Connect-SPOService –Url** <https://CKXXXX-admin.sharepoint.com> press **Enter** and **sign in**)

This command is going to permanently remove the project site collection from the recycle bin ignoring the 93 day countdown.

1. Remove-SPODeletedSite https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/ProjectSite (Replace the XXXX with your tenant number)
2. On the prompt enter **Y** and press **Enter**

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image614.png)

1. Return to the Site Collection active list in the SharePoint admin center and refresh the page, notice the project site is not there.
2. Now open the deleted sites page and you should not have anything left

By permanently purging the projects site collection you would now have to contact MS Support team to get it back which would be a timely and costly exercise so use the Deleted Site option only when you are 100% sure it is required.

# Exercise 10 - [Optional] Configure the app bar

The app bar offers a consistent navigation feature across all SharePoint sites. By default, the App bar will take users back to the SharePoint home page. But it can also be customised to allow an organisation to specify a selection of sites to be made accessible from this menu. You can even add your company logo to make it feel more branded.

1. In the SharePoint admin center open **Active sites**

1. Create a new Communication site called **Global news** with **Steve** as the owner
2. Open the SharePoint Online Management Shell in administrator mode and enter the following command to connect to the admin center:  

**Connect-SPOService -Url https://CKXXXX-admin.sharepoint.com** where XXXX is your unique number
3. If asked to sign in, use Steve’s email address and password
4. Next, we need to declare a home site in SharePoint, this would typically be something like an Intranet which may be as SharePoint hub site, we will use our Global news site in this example  

**Set-SPOhomesite -homesiteurl https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/globalnews** where XXXX is your unique number
5. Type in **Y** and then press **Enter**![Text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-592.png)

1. Back in the admin center, click on the URL for the Global news site to open the site  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-593.png)
2. Click on the **cog** and select **Global navigation** which is an option we only get on the elected Home site![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-594.png)  
If this option is missing, refresh the site and check again
3. Toggle Enable global navigation to **On**  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-595.png)

1. Scroll down and set the navigation to be based on the **Home site navigation**  

![Graphical user interface, text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-596.png)
2. Click **Save**
3. Refresh the page, then click on the **Home** icon in the app bar (note this logo could be customised in the Global navigation settings shown earlier  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-597.png)
4. This home menu will appear to all users in any SharePoint site, it’s links are the same as the home site, adding more links in the top link bar in the Global news site will add links to the global navigation (note if global news was a hub site, we can elect to use the hub navigation in the global navigation settings menu)

# Exercise 2 - Create a custom property mapped to a term set

In this exercise you will create a new People Term in the term store to allow a mapped custom property to use terms from the new term set.

1. In the SharePoint Admin center, in the left navigation select **Content services** and open **Term store**   

![Graphical user interface, application, Teams  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-606.png)  

The ![Home outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-607.png) **Taxonomy** section of the tree view will be selected, in the *Admins* section click **Edit** add Steve to the Term Store Administrators and click **Save** at the bottom of the page

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-608.png)

1. On the left-hand Navigation, next to *People* click **ellipsis (…)** (if not refresh your web browser), then choose **Add term set**

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-609.png)  

1. Call the new term set ‘Ranger Location’

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-610.png)  

1. Expand the Ranger Team and select **Add term**

![Graphical user interface, application, Word  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-611.png)  

1. Create 4 terms

1. East Yorkshire
2. West Yorkshire
3. North Yorkshire
4. South Yorkshire

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-612.png)  

1. Return to the user profile management page
2. Click on the **Manage User Properties** page
3. Click on **New Property**
4. Use the follow values to build the new property

1. Name = **RangerLocation**
2. Display Name = **Ranger Location**
3. Select **Configure a Term Set to be used for this property**

In the Term Set picker drop down select the **Ranger Location** term set  
![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-613.png)  

1. Description – **Which Yorkshire Region are you based at?**
2. Policy Setting = **Required** and **Everyone – User can override**

![Graphical user interface, text  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-614.png)

1. Edit Settings = tick the box **Allow users to edit values for this property**
2. Display Settings = Tick the boxes for **Show in the profile properties section of the user’s profile page** and **Show on the Edit Details page**

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-615.png)

1. Search Settings = Tick the box for Alias

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-616.png)

1. Click **OK** at the bottom of the page to create the custom property
2. Check that the new property is listed in the Custom Properties section  
![Icon  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-617.png)

It will take some time before the new property is available in the user’s profile page. In the next few steps, you will be shown a shortcut way to find them which works based on the current office 365 Delve options.  

1. On your Office 365 home page click on Steve’s name at the top right and click **My Office profile**
2. On the page click on the button for **Update profile** then expand **How can I add additional information?** and then click on the **here** to go to your classic profile  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-618.png)

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*This won’t be necessary once the new profile properties become available on the main profile page, it just takes time this helps speed the lab up.*  |

1. On the Edit Details page click on the additional options dots and select **Custom Properties**

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-619.png)  

1. You should have the two custom properties created, fill in the properties with the following information:

1. Ranger Team = **Blue**
2. Ranger Location + select the ‘**North Yorkshire**’ metadata value
3. Click **Save all and close** then click **OK**

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-620.png)

There will now be a delay before the new terms are available to be used due to the updates that take place in Office 365 and the timer jobs and crawl schedules.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| You will know everything has updated properly as the Additional information panel will appear on your normal profile page. This profile information can now be used as part of an audience, a search query and metadata use in document library columns. It can take a while for new profile columns to be available for use in search queries so have a try with finding user search data in the search module.  | A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with low confidence |

# Lab D – Working with data connections

SharePoint is the backbone of content in Office/Microsoft 365 and therefore has a high level of integration with the low code/no code developer stack, the Power Platform. In this lab we will explore the integration of SharePoint lists with Power Apps by building a custom mobile app, create a workflow with Power Automate and report on our data with Power BI.

# Exercise 3 – Analyse SharePoint data with Power BI

Lastly in this lab we will explore the data in our list with Power BI. Power BI can create a more customised report with the help of the Power BI Desktop application. To keep the process of analytics concerning this list as simple as possible, we will explore the web UI accessible directly from SharePoint.

1. Within the Sales Commission Payments list, select **Integrate**, then **Power BI** and finally **Visualize this list**

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-651.png)  

1. With our tenant you will have Power BI Pro as part of your E5 license, however you may need to sign in, to do so click **Have an account? Sign in** and sign in as Steve  

![Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-652.png)
2. Once signed in, repeat step 1 in the browser tab where your list is open, refreshing the page first (you can close the two Power BI tabs that opened)
3. A generic report will be compiled  

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-653.png)

1. The visualisations in the report are automatically generated based on the data in the list, on the left of the report is a pane called ‘Your data’ which is showing you the columns from our list
2. Each visual can be customised, position your mouse cursor over the visual titled, ‘Count of Commission by Title’ which is the orange clustered bar chart in the above image
3. Once your mouse cursor is positioned over the visual you will see a **Personalise this visual** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image697.png) icon, select it  

![Graphical user interface, PowerPoint  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-654.png)
4. Change the following properties in the ‘Personalize’ menu

1. Visualization type = **Donut chart** ![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image699.png)
2. Legend = **Commission Approval**
3. Values = **Compensation Amount**  
![Graphical user interface  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-655.png)

# Lab E – Managing the term store

The term store enables an organisational taxonomy so that grouping and identifying content can be consistent across all site collections. In this lab we will set up the term store, creating individual terms and synonyms and deploy them using a content type. We will also explore delegated access for the term store.

1. Sign out of Office 365 as Steve, close the browser  

Open a new browser and sign in to portal.office.com as [Pete@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Pete@CKXXXX.onmicrosoft.com) with a password of SpAdmin365. (replace XXXX with your tenant number)
2. Open <https://CKXXXX.sharepoint.com>/sites/cktraining replacing XXXX with your tenant name (Pete should have access to this site)
3. On the SharePoint **cog** click **Site information** – then **View all site settings**
4. In the Site Administration section click on **Term store management**

![Graphical user interface, text  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-714.png)  

You are now going to confirm that Pete has got the right delegated level of access to manage the term set and configure additional groups and permissions  

1. On the taxonomy page create a new term group called ‘Media’

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-715.png)  

1. Select the **Media** group and in the Group Managers section click **Edit** and add the following users:

1. Managers = **Shannen**
2. Contributors = **Ashley**
3. Click **Save**

# Lab F – Configuring Search

Search is a key tool for end users to quickly find content. Although search is great right out of the box, it can be customised based on an organisations needs. In this lab we will look at running a search query in the modern SharePoint search, searching hub sites and associated sites, creating search acronyms, bookmarks, locations and designing a Q&A experience.

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| psNote32 | NOTE:*This lab does rely on previous labs to work. However, if you do not have the destinations used in this lab you can create them as part of the exercises.*  |

IMPORTANT

Some of this lab requires that the search and intelligence is fully provisioned on your tenant which can take up to 3 days on a new trial tenant. If the tenant is not fully provisioned, you can return to some of the lab to complete it at a later time.

You can tell if your tenant is ready by checking the search and Intelligence admin page and clicking the configurations tab. You will see if the tenant is not yet provisioned for Microsoft search.

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-720.png)

To ensure there are some immediate take away skills from this exercise we will start off with exercises that are achievable without Microsoft Search being provisioned. All remaining exercises will be listed as optional, and as mentioned earlier, can be completed at a later time.

# Exercise 1 - Run a query in modern

In this exercise you will run a query using metadata in modern search and then elevate it to an organisational search query.

1. Login to Office 365 as Steve and open the sales site <https://ckXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/cktraining/sales> and replace XXXX with your tenant name
2. Open the Contracts document library
3. In the search box type ‘contract’

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-721.png)

You should see the two documents listed in the results pop up  

1. Press **Enter** to see the full search results page

1. In the results pop up box click on the **Expand search to all items in this site**

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-722.png)  

Now that you are at the site level for results you also get the sites included that host the documents and from here you can elevate your search to the organizational level  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-723.png)

1. Click on Organization in the navigation to do a top-level search

![Graphical user interface, application, Word  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-724.png)  

Notice that you now get more options in the filter and content type  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-725.png)  

1. In the search box type the word ‘shoe’ and press **Enter** – select files in the tabs  

![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image775.png)

1. You should now get 2 results listed

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-726.png)  

1. Now change the query to **contract AND shoe AND sales** and press **Enter**![Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image777.png)

You should now get filtered to one result. Sometimes teaching users simple search query terms can make searching content and metadata a lot simpler for them. Plus, it works in both modern and classic.

# Exercise 2 - Search across associated hub sites

In this exercise you will create some new documents and then search for them across hub sites.

1. Open the Customer alpha site **https://ckXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/CustomerAlpha**

1. Create a new document in the Documents library called ‘sales contract ford123’ and add the word ‘shoe’ into the document and close the document  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-728.png)
2. Open the Marketing site at **https://ckXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing** (Or click on Marketing on the top left nav, as it’s linked through a hub association)
3. Create a new document in the documents folder called ‘sales contract kia456’ and add the word ‘shoe’ into the document and close the document  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-729.png)
4. Wait a few minutes for the crawl to run (Can take up to 5 minutes)
5. Return to the Marketing home page and in the search bar type ‘contract’, note if you are told we couldn’t find any results on this site, refresh the search

Once the crawl has finished updating you will see two search results for the new documents only from the associated hub sites  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-730.png)

1. Click on **Organization** to expand the search beyond the hub sites, notice you now get many more results covering all sites

# Exercise 3 – Create an audience targeted search web part

In this exercise we will set up a highlighted content web part. These web parts can be customised with a search query to help promote specific content. In addition to this, web parts can also be audience targeted at specific Microsoft 365 groups, we will aim to show this web part to a more exclusive audience.

1. Firstly, we will need to map a crawled property to a managed property, to do this navigate to the SharePoint admin center as Steve

Note that site columns do not need to be mapped to managed properties, we only need to do this because the column we wish to reference is a library column  

1. In the left navigation select **More features** and under Search click **Open**  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-732.png)

1. Select **Manage Search Schema**  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-733.png)

1. Click on the **Crawled Properties** tab  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-734.png)
2. In the Filter box, type ‘product’ into the Crawled properties field and click on the green **apply** button  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-735.png)
3. Select **ows\_Producttype**, this is a column we created in our Contracts library in an earlier exercise, this is the crawled result  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-736.png)
4. We now need to map this crawled property to a managed property that we can use in KQL query, click on the **Add a Mapping** button  

![Application  Description automatically generated with medium confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-737.png)
5. SharePoint has some generic managed properties that we can link our crawled properties to, you can use the **Next** arrow to scroll through and select **RefinableString00(Text)**, or you can use the search to make this easier by entering in **RefinableString** and selecting **Find**

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-738.png)  

This menu can be tricky to work with as it has two scroll bars, use the outer scroll bar to get to the OK button

1. Ensure the property appears as shown below  

![Graphical user interface, application, Word  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-739.png)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **OK**

We can now reference RefinableString00 in our KQL query, to use KQL query in a web part, open the marketing site collection home page as Steve **https://ckXXXX.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing**  

1. On the home page of the Marketing site, click **Edit** at the top right edge of the page  

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-740.png)

1. Move your mouse cursor to the white area above the News web part, an add web part button will appear, click on the **(+)**  

![Graphical user interface, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-741.png)
2. In the web part menu, search for ‘highlighted content’

1. Select the **Highlighted content** web part  

![Graphical user interface, text, application, email  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-742.png)
2. At the top left of the web part, type in the title ‘Sales contracts’  

![Graphical user interface, application, Word  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-743.png)
3. With the web part selected, click on the **Edit** button in the menu  

![Graphical user interface, application, Word  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-744.png)
4. Currently the web part is displaying all files in the hub, which includes the Marketing and the Customer Alpha sites, this can be customised further as a Filter or a Custom query

The filter offers a more user friendly way to write queries allowing end users to select the scope and parameters of the filter without using code, however the Custom query although requiring either KQL or CAML queries to run can offer more options, select **Custom query**  

![Graphical user interface, text, application  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-745.png)  

1. In the Source drop down select **All sites** to give us a larger scope of content to work with (presently we do not have a large amount of content in SharePoint)  

![A picture containing background pattern  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-746.png)
2. In the Query text (KQL) enter the following:

1. filetype:docx RefinableString00:shoe

1. Click **Apply**, note that it will take time for the search crawl to pick up the assignment of our crawled properties association with the managed property, RefinableString00, therefore when you click **Apply** below the Query text, you’ll either see the correct results (bottom left) or the unsuccessful query (bottom right)

| --- | --- |
| A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with medium confidence | A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated with low confidence |

If your results are unsuccessful, do not worry, the query is correct and will work once the properties are crawled, for now continue with the exercise  

1. In the Sort by drop down select **Most viewed**

1. Next enable audience targeting  

![Text  Description automatically generated with low confidence](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-749.png)

![Graphical user interface, application, table  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-750.png)
3. At the top of the page, in the ribbon click **Republish** and confirm by selecting **Republish**
4. We have enabled audience targeting in the web part, this means that we can configure the library so that the files only appear to specific audiences, to do this, navigate to

5. Select the ‘Contracts’ library

1. Click on the **Cog** and then choose **Library settings**

# Lab G – Configuring Apps

SharePoint hosts a range of services, and where limits are reached, third parties often extend a helping hand in the form of an app. Traditionally in on-premises SharePoint deployments, organisations could install integrated applications to bring new capabilities to SharePoint like governance, automation and other enhancements. In the cloud, this is achieved by either acquiring apps from the app store or installing an app file. Once installed, end users can leverage these apps and admins can track their use.

# Lab H – ECM

Enterprise Content Management is a means to deliver consistent experiences across multiple site collections. This deliverance can be quite broad and can include governance through labelling and retention, to records management. In this lab we will cover this spectrum including retention, eDiscovery, data loss prevention, in place records and records centers. Note that the last two topics are optional and could be covered in your own time.

# Exercise 1 - Create a Retention Label

In this first exercise you will create a new retention label that also has classifiers and a record declaration action. To create labels, you must have the AIP feature enabled on your tenant. If you are using an E5 trial / tenant, then you will already have this feature. If you are using an E3 tenant, you will first need to add the AIP Plan to your tenant and users.

Although you will create the label now it will not be possible to use / see the label immediately after publishing it as it will take several hours before it is published and available in SharePoint. Therefore, after finishing this exercise, you can return to SharePoint and the label will be available to use.

1. Expand Admin center and open the **Compliance** admin center

![A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WebucatorTraining/skillable/main/55238/images/image-824.png)
